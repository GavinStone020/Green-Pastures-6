		<h2>Training packages</h2>
		<p> We offer several types of training packages. Whether your horse is completely green, needs a tune up, or is starting in a new discipline, we can customize a training package to meet your needs.</p>
		<h3> Full-time training </h3>
		<p> Horses in fulltime training are worked by our trainers five times a week, with goals tailored to the owner. Fulltime training includes full-board. </p>
		<h3> Part-time Training </h3>
		<p> Horses in part-time training will be worked 3 times a week. Part-time training can be packaged with full or partial care board. </p>
		<h3> Individual Training Sessions </h3>
		<p> Individual training sessions are available for both boarders and clients who would like to haul in. Individual training sessions are not packaged with board. </p>
